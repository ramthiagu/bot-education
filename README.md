* [Bot Framework Developer portal](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new) where you can register a new bot.

## Cognitive Services

* MS [Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services) for ML APIs, some of which are:
  * [Computer Vision](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api)

  --> Once subscribed, these should link out to your Reference API (a link will appear on the service main page) for your Cognitive Services account if you have one.  This will give you sample code for different services in many, many languages including python 2/3, C#, and JavaScript.
  
  * Sample (python 2.7) [code](https://text-analytics-demo.azurewebsites.net/Home/SampleCode) for text analytics used in this repo.

## Github Repos to know about

* Microsoft's BotBuilder: https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder (also, contains sample CSharp and Node.js code)
* Build your own bots based on Github's Hubot: https://github.com/github/hubot

## Blogs and Articles (MS and non-MS)

* [Bot Design Patterns](http://willschenk.com/bot-design-patterns/?imm_mid=0e50a2&cmp=em-data-na-na-newsltr_20160622)

* Even though bots and the Microsoft Bot Framework are not really A.I., [this](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/06/microsoft_ceo_satya_nadella_humans_and_a_i_can_work_together_to_solve_society.html) article by Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella, published June 28, 2016, highlights some values and principles to guide our thinking, design and development of A.I.  The values and principles do apply very readily to bots and their design and development.

* In [this](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/bot-framework-made-better-with-azure/) blog by Jeff Holan, a Bot Framework solution is shown with integration into Logic Apps.
